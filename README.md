This repository contains the implementation of an AI agent to play the game of Connect Four, developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course project.
Project Overview:
    The objective of this project is to create an AI agent capable of playing Connect Four using two different search algorithms: Alpha-Beta Pruning and Expectimax. The agent selects the optimal move given the current state of the board.
    The project includes a simple GUI to visualize the game. The top text displays the player making the next move, and the well-drawn circles in the middle represent the game board.
    This is a group course project.
